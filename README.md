# Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently building [Terminal Land](https://terminal.land), an extremely ambitious multiplayer interactive fiction game. If that sounds like your kind of thing, check it out! (And please check it out anyway, in case itâ€™s your kind of thing but you just donâ€™t know it yet.)

Most of my projects can be found in the [Neatnik repositories](https://github.com/neatnik).
